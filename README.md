# Features
- Compile jade in to html

# Usage

To auto compile `.scss` and `.js` from `src` to `assets` folder:
```
grunt watch
```
and go to http://localhost:3001/


To convert jade into html:
```
grunt jade
```

# Bugs are waiting for fixed
- `postcss` cannot use
- `stylelint` is annoying
- read markdown `include:md` is red dot in atom editor
- `.sass-cache` folder is created
```
Sass cache files speed up compilation based on whether a Sass file has changed since last compile.
```
